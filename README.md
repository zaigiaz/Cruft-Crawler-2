# Cruft-Crawler-Offline-AI-Driven-Background-Disk-Cleanup
Cruft Crawler is an LLM-first background agent that runs entirely offline from a 64 GB USB drive. It profiles the filesystem over 14 days with imperceptible CPU load, uses a local quantized LLM to recommend safe deletions, and delivers a concise AI-generated report. No PII ever leaves the machine.
