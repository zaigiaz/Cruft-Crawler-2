QUESTIONS

BIG PICTURE:
    -What parts of the project would you say are must-have versus nice-to-have?

HOW IT SHOULD RUN:
    -When someone plugs in the USB, should it start automatically, or is it okay if they run it manually?
    -Do you expect it to work on Windows or Linux or both?

AI MODEL:
    -Do you want the AI to say KEEP/DELETE or explain why in simple language?


NOTES:
    -simplest thing is something like every ten seconds wake up and make a function call
    -find files that are taking up space and trash
    -look at file, file date, file structure, blah blah file stats
    -simple dialogue
    -can you do it? (if cant do it, present why not possible)
    -NOT MAKING UI PRETTY
    -files to get rid of and AI gen reason to get rid of
    -button to either get rid of file, or mark as not ask again
    
    -when a paragraph is sent to the AI, that is 100'000s of tokens
        -can you feed it like 100 at a time?

    -file system profiling
        -not giving LLM bash
        -prob writing a for loop to walk thru folders and feeding LLM

    -can choose any OS, but multi is ideal
    
    -prompt the model 
    -could have ai respond with json with number rating and description of why to delete?
